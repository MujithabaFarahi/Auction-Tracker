Auction Tracker Platform – MVP Build Requirements (Codex Instructions)

1. Purpose

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) web application to track a live cricket player auction.

This MVP is NOT a full tournament management system.
It is ONLY for running and viewing a single auction for one tournament.

2. Technology Stack (Fixed)

Frontend: React (web)

Database: Firebase Firestore

Authentication: Firebase Auth (Admin only)

Real-time: Firestore real-time listeners (no WebSockets)

3. Core Rules (DO NOT DEVIATE)

✅ Only ONE tournament

✅ Only auction tracking

❌ No multi-tournament support

❌ No payments

❌ No analytics

❌ No chat, notifications, or extras

❌ No captain logins (view-only)

4. User Roles
   4.1 Admin

Authenticated using Firebase Auth

Can create, edit, and update everything

Controls the auction

4.2 Team Captains (View-Only)

NO AUTH REQUIRED

Can only view auction state

Cannot edit, bid, or modify anything

5. Data Model (Firestore)
   5.1 Tournament (single document)
   tournament {
   name: string
   season: string
   }

Only one document exists.

5.2 Teams (collection)
teams {
id: string
name: string
captainName: string
totalPurse: number
remainingPurse: number
}

Rules:

Remaining purse must never go below zero

5.3 Players (collection)
players {
id: string
name: string
contactNumber: string
role: string
basePrice: number
status: "AVAILABLE" | "SOLD"
soldToTeamId: string | null
soldPrice: number | null
}

Allowed roles (exact values):

Batsman

Bowler

All-rounder

Wicket-keeper batsman

Pace bowling all-rounder

Spin bowling all-rounder

5.4 Auction State (single document)
auctionState {
currentPlayerId: string | null
currentBid: number
leadingTeamId: string | null
status: "IDLE" | "LIVE" | "SOLD"
}

6. Functional Requirements (MVP)
   6.1 Admin Authentication

Firebase Auth email/password login

Only logged-in admins can access admin screens

No role management needed (any logged-in user = admin)

6.2 Team Setup (Admin)

Admin can:

Create teams

Set team name, captain name, total purse

View remaining purse (auto-calculated)

No editing during live auction (optional but preferred).

6.3 Player Setup (Admin)

Admin can:

Add players to player pool

Edit player details before auction

Cannot edit player once sold

6.4 Auction Control (ADMIN ONLY)

Admin can:

Select a player to auction

Start auction

Enter/update bid amount manually

Select leading team

Mark player as SOLD

When player is marked SOLD:

Deduct bid amount from team remaining purse

Update player status to SOLD

Assign player to team

Reset auction state for next player

System must block:

Bids higher than team’s remaining purse

6.5 View-Only Auction Screen (Captains)

Captains can see:

Current auction player

Player role & base price

Current bid

Leading team

Team-wise remaining purse

Players already sold to teams

No buttons.
No inputs.
Read-only.

7. UI Pages (Minimal)
   Admin Pages

/admin/login

/admin/setup (teams + players)

/admin/auction

Public View Page

/auction/view

8. Real-Time Behaviour

Use Firestore listeners

Any admin change must reflect instantly on viewer screens

Page refresh acceptable (no socket requirement)

9. Validation Rules (Critical)

Team purse cannot go below zero

Player can only be sold once

Only one active auction at a time

Auction must have a selected player

10. Out of Scope (Do NOT Implement)

❌ Multiple tournaments

❌ Captain login

❌ Auto bidding logic

❌ Undo / history

❌ Notifications

❌ Mobile app

❌ Styling beyond basic usability

11. Definition of Done (MVP Complete When)

Admin can run a full auction end-to-end

Team budgets are accurate

Captains can view auction live

Data persists correctly in Firestore

No team can overspend

12. Future (Explicitly Deferred)

Multiple tournaments

Role-based permissions

Auction history

Mobile support

Advanced real-time features



MVP UPDATE: Live Bidding History (MANDATORY FEATURE)
1. Requirement Summary

During a live auction, the system MUST display the full bidding sequence for the currently auctioned player.

This is a must-have feature, not optional.

Captains and admins must be able to see:

Who bid

How much was bid

In what order the bids happened

This improves transparency and trust in the auction.

2. Bidding Flow (Expected Behaviour)

Example scenario:

Player base price: 20,000

Team A bids: 20,000

Team B bids: 25,000

Team C bids: 30,000

Team A bids: 40,000

Team B bids: 50,000 (winning bid)

👉 All of the above bids must appear live on the screen in sequence.

3. Data Model Update (Firestore)
3.1 Bid History (Subcollection or Array)
Option A (Preferred – scalable)

Subcollection under current auction player:

players/{playerId}/bids/{bidId}

bid {
  teamId: string
  teamName: string
  amount: number
  timestamp: number
}

Option B (Simpler – acceptable for MVP)

Array inside auctionState:

auctionState {
  currentPlayerId: string | null
  currentBid: number
  leadingTeamId: string | null
  status: "IDLE" | "LIVE" | "SOLD"
  bidHistory: [
    {
      teamId: string
      teamName: string
      amount: number
      timestamp: number
    }
  ]
}


⚠️ Either approach is fine for MVP, but bid history must be persisted, not UI-only.

4. Functional Requirements – Bid History
4.1 Admin Actions

When admin enters a new bid:

The bid must be appended to bid history

The UI must update immediately

The system must:

Validate team purse

Update currentBid

Update leadingTeamId

Admin cannot delete or edit previous bids.

4.2 Live View (Admin + Captains)

The auction screen MUST show:

Base price

Current highest bid

Leading team

Scrollable bid history list, showing:

Team name

Bid amount

Order (latest on top or bottom)

Example UI (simple):

BID HISTORY
------------------
Team A – 20,000
Team B – 25,000
Team C – 30,000
Team A – 40,000
Team B – 50,000


✔ Updates in real time using Firestore listeners
✔ Visible to both admin and view-only captains

5. Auction Completion Rule (With Bid History)

When admin marks player as SOLD:

Winning bid = last entry in bid history

Player record updated:

status = SOLD

soldPrice = winning bid amount

soldToTeamId = winning team

Team purse deducted

Auction state reset:

currentPlayerId = null

currentBid = 0

leadingTeamId = null

bidHistory = []

6. Validation Rules (Critical)

Every bid must be ≥ base price

Every bid must be greater than previous bid

Team purse must be sufficient

Bid history must be append-only

No bid updates allowed after player is SOLD

7. MVP Boundary (Reconfirmed)

Still OUT OF SCOPE:

Bid undo

Bid deletion

Bid analytics

Auto-increment bidding

Multiple auctions at once

8. Updated MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful only if:

Live bid history is visible during auction

Bids appear instantly for captains

Winning bid is clearly traceable

Auction transparency is guaranteed
